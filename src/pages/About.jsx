            <p>Thanks for checking out my portfolio! I am currently a coding bootcamp student. I've been interested in tech my whole life and enjoy building custom PCs. Outside of class I work in a restaurant. I also enjoy fishing, hiking, and playing video games. In the 'My Projects' section you will find screenshots of my projects which are linked to the deployed product. In the 'Contact Info' section you will find a link to my Github and my email address.
